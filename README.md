## Curriculum Creation

* Make sure that all curricula are in line with the GDI mission and an appropriate topic/level for our members. This may include:
	* Topics that complement and expand our existing curriculum
	* Industry-relevant topics for advanced students (these students already work in the industry and range from Associate/Junior to Senior and above)
	* Topics that students have requested to learn
* Would you like to fork an existing workshop? Check out these resources:

* If you want your workshop to be included on our [national website](https://www.girldevelopit.com/materials), check out this [review rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zw7qX2EAO08rGAjl9683aVxtsAoZQLxmy7evu2my4OY/edit). Please note that this is not a requirement for inclusion in this organization.

## Class Slides
We use reveal.js for all our slides. If you are creating new slides from scratch, start by forking this repo: https://github.com/gdi-nyc/reveal.js. There are instructions for how reveal.js works if you aren't familiar with it.
